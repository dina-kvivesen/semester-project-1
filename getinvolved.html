        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. 
            Donations are very welcome and are an important way 
            we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole 
            community.</p>
        <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to 
            the museum’s collections. If you have some item or 
            collection that you think others would enjoy, please let 
            us know by contacting our Collections Department and 
            they will be able to assist you.</p>

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you 
            enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of 
            nature with people? Well you could be just the right 
            person to enjoy an internship at the museum.</p>
        <p>You’ll be learning from a number of different academics 
            and people who are passionate about science and 
            sharing it with the wider community.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to 
            keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors 
            to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including 
            getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
            access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where 
            all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas 
            for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
        <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
            Please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us if you’d like to find out more about 
            how you can get involved.</p>
