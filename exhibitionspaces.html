        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic 
            exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and 
            what we can see and know about the universe around us. 
            We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that 
            can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who 
            used the stars to travel by.</p>
        <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early 
            Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration 
            of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled 
            with the question of our origins. Where do we come from 
            and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his 
            theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring 
            and understanding our place in this world. </p>
        <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet 
            and how the species we know today have evolved our time. 
            You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures 
            who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, 
            the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <h2>Biology and medicine</h2>
        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
            breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights 
            into the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
        <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and 
            their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth 
            of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits 
            we explore the history of medicine and take a look at 
            some major breakthroughs including the discovery of 
            penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not 
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the 
            wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial 
                    intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home 
                    applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is 
                    here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having 
                on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists 
                explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans 
                but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers 
                    we currently face including global warming, extinction of 
                    species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways 
                    we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
